## 🛠️ Techniques Explored

This repository contains practical case studies for the following statistical methods:

* **📈 Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing the main features of a dataset, including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation).

* **⚖️ T-Tests:** Used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. The t-statistic is calculated as:
    $$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

* **🔬 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Used to test for significant differences between the means of three or more groups by analyzing their variances.

* **🔗 Correlation:** Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) is calculated as:
    $$r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$

* **📉 Linear Regression:** A method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The simple linear regression equation is:
    $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$$

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project is contained within its own folder and includes:

* An **Excel workbook** (`.xlsx`) with the raw data, analysis, and visualizations.
* A **summary document** (`.md` or `.pdf`) explaining the project's objective, methodology, and key findings.
